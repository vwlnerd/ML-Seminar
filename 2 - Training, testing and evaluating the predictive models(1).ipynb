Notable is also the circumstance, that other than expected, the model on the median imputed data with removed premium outliers performed much worse than the linear models on the datasets with outliers, namely the first and last model. A possible reason may be, that too many observations with high equity premium were removed. However, removing these outliers but enriching the data with macroeconomic indicators enhanced the performance of the multiple regression model remarkably. The test score for the third model reached 59.11% of accuracy which is almost double of the score if we would randomly assign the shares to a class (33.33%).

This time, the accuracy scores on the train and test sets are similar throughout all used datasets. Once again, the median imputed data with removed outliers and added economic indicators stands out with the highest prediction accuracy on the test set. We also denote, that the second dataset (median_no) has now a slighty higher score compared to the dataset with included equity premium outliers. Hence removing premium outliers and than also adding economic indicators both improve the performance of this linear model. Here, the model for the iteratively imputed data had the worst accuracy, but still better compared to its score on the linear regression model with no penalty."

In this case however, QDA has an even worse performance than randomly guessing the class labes in the first two datasets. The main reason for this poor performance probably is due to the high number of features and the existing multicollinearity. As QDA is more flexible than LDA, it is also more exposed to this issues which lead to very high variances and eventually to a worse prediction accuracy in this case. "

    "Ever since they were introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001, random forests have been often used and met with approval especially because they can handle complex data and are less prone to overfitting than single decision trees. The idea of random forests is to use bootstrapped samples from the original data (sample from the data with replacement) and then fit a decision tree on each sample. It is important to note that random forests only use a randomly chosen subset of covariates at each split. This is done to decrease correlation between trees. Finally, random forests follow a majority vote principle for classification to choose how to classify each new observation.\n"

    "SVM are supervised learning models which we will use to classify our data. Introduced by Vapnik and colleagues in the 1990s (Boser et al. (1992), Guyon et al. (1993) and Vapnik et al. (1997)). We chose to use SVMs as they are shown to be quite robust prediction methods. SVMs can also be used to conduct linear, as well as non-linear prediction. In this notebook, we will apply SVM in many different ways, while integrating different ideas from other algorithms in order to improve perfomance. We start with a simple linear model.\n",

We can see that the precisions and the confusion matrices show a similar picture for all the datasets. Using `class_weight = \"balanced\"`, we were able to imrove the accuracy of predicting a \"hold\" share as such, hence improving the precision for the least represented class. However, our overall accuracies shrunk from around 60% to 40%, hence significantly degrading the performance of the models. Therefore, we state that considering class imbalance leads to worse prediction models in this case."

    "Overall, SVMs allowed us to create many different classifications. It was possible to consider issues like class imbalance on the way. The performance of the classifiction was extremely stable throughout the different algorithms except for the class-balanced models which downgraded the prediction accuracies. Using more complex models, pipelines or tackling class imbalance all where unable to improve performance in a large way. This is to some extent not so surprising as the dataset had many NaNs which had to be imputed, so producing strong classification was going to be hard anyways. The high dimensionality of the data probably had a negative effect on performance as well."

    "Overall, it is obvious that the issues with the datasets discussed above had a detrimental impact on the precision of our recommendation algorithms. In most of the years our test score was only slightly better than always classifying a stock as the class with the highest occurrences. \n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the different methods of data preparation, we see that the models on the three datasets with sector-wise median imputed values had higher scores than the models on the data prepared with the Random Forest iterative imputer. Hence, the more sophisticated method was not worth the effort. When comparing the median imputed datasets with each other, removing equity premium outliers slightly improved the results for all algorithms except for the Multiple Linear Regression with no penalty. However, these improvements were rather marginal. Adding extra economic indicators was able to improve the test scores more significantly in most cases, thus this way of data preparation resulted in the best prediction performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the used algorithms, it is easier to mark out the two that performed poorly: **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**. Especially QDA had a bad performance on all datasets. The remaining algorithms achieved performances on the test sets around 55% to 60%. The model with the highest accuracy scores was the hyperparameter fine-tuned **SVM** which got around 60% of test set accuracy among all datasets. **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** achieved slighty inferior accuracies, but still rather robust scores among the different datasets. The **Linear Ridge Classifier**, **Logistic Regression with Lasso penalty** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis** also achieved test scores around 60% for the median imputed data with no outliers and added economic indicators, but got inferior results on the remaining datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest test score is achieved with SVM on the sector-wise median imputed dataset with removed equity premium outliers. Therefore, our investment recommendations correspond to the predicted classifications of this model."
